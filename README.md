# Boclips JS Security

This is a client-side library talking to Keycloak to negotiate login credentials.

It works by authenticating, and then intercepting all Axios calls by attaching a `Authorization: Bearer $token`.

Development tasks:
```
npm run test
```
```
npm run e2e
```
```
npm run lint
```

Run an example app:
```
npm run demo
```
